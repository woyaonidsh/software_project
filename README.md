# ASE assignment--pair project
This is a team assignment from our ASE course, and the project was achieved by our team. [Here](https://www.cnblogs.com/xinz/archive/2011/11/27/2265000.html) is source address of the task.

> How is the frequency of English 26 letters distributed in a novel? What are the words that often appear in a type of article? What is the most common vocabulary of a author? What are the most commonly used phrases in Harry Potter, and so on. There are some programs to solve this problem.
## step0: *Outputs the frequency of the 26 letters in an English text file.*

### Usage:
   	python wf.py [-c] [-n <num>] <path> 
_____________________________________________ 
    -c:Count character occurrences.  
    -n <num>: Output only the top <num> items. (default: n=10)
    <path>: The path to the input file if -d is not specified. 
### Examples:
	cd step0
    python wf.py -c gone_with_the_wind.txt
    python wf.py -c -6 gone_with_the_wind.txt
### Output:

## step1: *Output the top N most frequently occurring English words in a single file*
### Usages:

	python wf.py -f <path> : Output all non-repeating words in the file  
	python wf.py -d <directory> : Specify the file directory ,and perform the same operation for each file in the directory  
	python wf.py -d -s <directory> :Recursively traverse all subdirectories under the directory
	python wf.py [-f|-d][-s][-n] : Output only the top <num> items. (default: n=10)
### Examples:
	cd step1-2 
	python wf.py -f ../txtfiles/gone_with_the_wind.txt
	python wf.py -d ../txtfiles/examples
	python wf.py -d -s ../txtfiles/examples

## step5: *Counting "Verb Phrases"*
The definition of "Verb Phrases" is as follows:

	VerbPhrase := Verb + Spaces + Preposition
	Spaces := Space+
	Space := ' ' | '\t' | '\r' | '\n'
	Preposition := <any one from the list of prepositions>
	Verb := <any one in any tense FROM THE DICTIONARY>
### Usage:
    python wf.py -q <preposition-list> -v <verb-dict> <path>
### Example:

    python wf.py -q prepositions.txt -v verbs.txt ../txtfiles/gone_with_the_wind.txt
